# Class 04 Reading Notes

## Creating hyperlinks in HTML

- wrap inside an 'a' element
- within the 'a' element place href='link'
- a heading can be made a link by placing the 'a' element above the heading.

## Images as a link in HTML

- place the image source within the 'a' element after the href.

## CSS Flow

- Flexbox (one dimensional)
  - rows/columns
  - Items grow & shrink to "flex" into open space
- Grids (two dimensional)
  - rows/columns
  - simplifies complex layouts
- Floats
  - floats images inside of text
- Positioning
  - allows normal flow rules to be broken

## JS Functions

- Make code reusable
- After a function is created it must be invoked to be used

## Pair Programming

- Driver: person typing, file swapping, version control
- Navigator: gives verbal guidance to the driver, looks up solutions for bugs, big picture focused
