### Five Differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

- Data Model.

  - SQL is organized via rows and columns. 
  - NoSQL is more flexible in its structure.

- Scalability.

  - SQL is sclaed by adding resources to a single server.
  - NoSQL is can handle more data bc it uses more servers.

- Query Language.

  - SQL uses structured query language (SQL) to interact with the database.
  - NoSQL databases use different query languages depending on the database type.

- ACID

  - SQL databases generally adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.
  - NoSQL databases often sacrifice strict ACID compliance for higher scalability and performance.

- Use Cases

  - SQL databases are well-suited for applications that require complex queries, data integrity, and transactions

  - 

### SQL Data

- financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and applications with highly structured data.

### Example:
