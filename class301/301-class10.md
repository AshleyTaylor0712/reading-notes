 Class 10 Reading Notes

### What is a ‘call’?

- An invocation of a function
- Creates a new frame (execution context)
- Pushes to call stack

### How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

- One

### What does LIFO mean?

- Last In, First out
- Most recently added item is the first to be removed/executed

### Example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

- Empty stack
- A function is invoked firing another invocation until all functions are invoked
- When the most recent funtion executes it is then removed from the stack
- This process repeats until stack is empty again.

### Reference Error

- error that is produced when trying to reference/access a variable or funciton that does not exist

### Syntax Error

- Occurs when code is written incorrectly/violates syntax rules of language

### Range Error

- Value is out of range, Invalid value, Exceeds limit

### Type Error

- operation is not valid for the types involved

### Breakpoint

- point where code execution is paused
- allows for inspection of state & variables

### Debugger

- Pause execution of code and activates debugging tools
