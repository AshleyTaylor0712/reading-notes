# Operators & Loops

### Expresssion

Expressions can be used in a variety of contexts in JavaScript such as:

    -variable assignments

    -conditional statements

    -loops

    -function calls

### Array
A data structure that stores a collection of values such as numbers, strings, objects, or other arrays.

To create an array enclose a list of values inside square brackets "[]". Separate array items by commas.

>Ex. var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

### Loops

A loop allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is met.

**Types:**

>"for" most common
>>ex. Make an array:
>>var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
>>
>>`-`Use a "for" loop to iterarte the array numbers:
>>
>>for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  console.log(numbers[i]);
}
