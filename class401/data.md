# Data Structures and Algorithms

## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

When deciding which data structure to use for a problem, it's important to consider how well the data structure performs the specific operations needed. Different data structures are good at different things. Some are better for adding or removing elements, while others are better for finding or getting elements quickly. By understanding the operations required and how well each data structure handles them, you can choose the best one for your problem.

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, we need to have a stopping point in our recursive function called a base case. The base case stops the recursion and returns a result instead of calling the function again. Without a base case, the function will keep calling itself forever and cause problems. Having a base case ensures that the recursion will eventually stop and prevent any issues.
