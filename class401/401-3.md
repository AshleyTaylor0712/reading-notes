## Python with statement

- Ensures proper handling of files
- Sets up a controlled space for interaction
- Ensures necessary preparations
- performs cleanup by closing files
- Manages resources and safeguards against usage issues

## Read() vs readline()

- Read takes in all the data in a file and returns it as a string; Lets you read entire file at once
- Readline only returns a single line from a file. Also returns as a string; Allows you read the file line by line

## Exception Handling

- Useful for handling errors and ensures proper code execution
- Try: used for code that may cause and exception
- Except: handles the exception when it occurs
- Finally: Cleans up operations when executed
