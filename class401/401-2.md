## Test-Driven Development

Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python follows key principles like writing tests first, fixing them, and improving the code in small steps. It helps create high-quality code by focusing on requirements, catching bugs early, and allowing safe code modifications. TDD encourages comprehensive testing, leading to better design, faster debugging, and increased code coverage. By writing tests before the code, developers can ensure that their code works as intended and is easier to maintain and understand.

## Conditional Code

The if __name__ == '__main__': statement in Python helps us know if a script is being run directly or being used as part of another script. By including this statement, we can choose to execute specific code only when the script is run directly. It's useful for testing our code, organizing reusable parts, and preventing unintended execution when the script is imported.

## Recursion

Recursion in Python is when a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's like a loop where the function keeps calling itself until it reaches a specific condition, called the base case. Each time the function calls itself, it breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems.

## Modules vs Packages:

Both modules and packages help organize and reuse code in Python, making it easier to maintain and preventing code duplication. Modules are individual files, while packages are directories containing multiple modules.

- To Create a Module: make a new Python file and define code inside it

- To create a directory: "__init__.py" file,

- Importing: To import a module from a package, use the package name and the module name separated by a dot in the import statement.
