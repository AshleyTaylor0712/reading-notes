## What I bring to the table:

The one unique quality I bring to my career and potential employers is my exceptional ability to persevere through hardship. In the face of challenges and obstacles, I consistently demonstrate resilience, determination, and a never-give-up attitude. I possess the mental fortitude to overcome setbacks, adapt to changing circumstances, and maintain focus on achieving my goals. My unwavering perseverance not only fuels my own personal growth and development but also inspires those around me, creating a positive and driven work environment. With this invaluable quality, I am equipped to tackle difficult situations, find creative solutions, and ultimately contribute to the success of both my career and the organizations I work with.

## Getting Unstuck

When I get stuck on a tough piece of code, logic, or feature, I will do three things to "un-stick" myself. First, I'll take a break and do something else to clear my mind and gain a fresh perspective. Then, I'll seek help and collaborate with classmate to gain insights and guidance. Lastly, I'll break down the problem into smaller parts, analyze each part, and gradually work towards a solution. By following these steps, I can overcome challenges and find effective solutions to move forward.
