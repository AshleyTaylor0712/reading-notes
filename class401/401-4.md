# Class 04

## Classes vs Objects

- A class defines the strucutre while an object is created using the structure defined via the class
- Classes are made up of:
  
  - Attributes: Characteristics
  - Methods: What they do

- Objects have specific attribute values that are taken for the class

## Recursion

- Function that calls itself
- Breaks down a complex problem into manageable chucks that are solved until a basecase is reached
- Best Practices:

  - define base cases to terminate process
  - establish input validation & edge cases

## Pytest Fixtures

- Manage test dependencies

## Code Coverage

- identifies areas of code that have been tested and assesses the effectiveness of the tests being performed

 When used together they increase quality of code and its maintainability by providing reliable test setup and identifying untested areas.
