## 1. What is a linked list?

-a  A sequence of nodes connected by links/pointers.

-b A collection of functions used for list operations.

-c A data structure that contains arrays.

## 2. What are the two types of linked lists mentioned in the text?

-a Singly and circular.

-b Doubly and circular.

-c Singly and doubly.

## 3. What is the purpose of the "Next" property in a node?

-a It stores the value of the current node.

-b It contains the reference to the next node in the linked list.

-c It points to the previous node in a doubly linked list.

## 4. How can you traverse a linked list?

-a Using a for loop.

-b Using a while loop and the "Next" property of each node.

-c Using a foreach loop.

## 5. What is the time complexity of the Includes method for searching a value in a linked list?

-a O(1)

-b O(log n)

-c O(n)

## 6. What is the time complexity of adding a node to the beginning of a linked list?

-a O(n)

-b O(log n)

-c O(1)

## 7. When adding a node in the middle of a linked list, what is the time complexity?

-a O(n)

-b O(1)

-c O(log n)

## 8. How is a new node added in the middle of a linked list?

- a By creating a new linked list starting from the new node.

-b By inserting the new node after the last node in the list.

-c By assigning the "Next" property of the new node to the next node and updating the previous node's "Next" property.

## 9. How can you print out all the nodes in a linked list?

-a Using a while loop and the "Next" property of each node.

-b Using a for loop.

-c Using a foreach loop.
